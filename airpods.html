    <h1>I washed my airpods in the washing machine</h1>
    <p>I went out with the airpods in ears. Surprise, surprise, the right one wasn't charged. Grrr, you have no idea how often that happens. The case wasn't on me, so I stashed them in the back pocket of my jeans. Next day, I shoved the jeans into the washing machine, without too much thought. Only half an hour later when I noticed the airpods' case in the wrong place did my brain put together what had happened.<br>
    I just washed my airpods. In fact they are still washing. How lame. I rushed to the washing machine. Stopped it. Ran the draining program. And from the soapy tumble of cloth fished out the two white pieces.</p>
    <p>They are now drying on a silica gel baggie. I didn't do that at first. Sort of just left them on the counter.<br>
    But finally, the years worth of collecting silica gel bags have payed off. That's what you should do by the way. You should put your wet, fished out airpods in silica gel. Not on the baggie, put it straight in the gel. It's your best chance of sucking the mousture out fast enough to not damange the internals.</p>
    <p>Update - after a full day resting on the silica gel, they work.</p>
