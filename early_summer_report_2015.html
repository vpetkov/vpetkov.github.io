    <h2>Early Summer Report</h2>

    <p>As I promised to myself, now more than a couple of weeks ago, I started shooting exclusively with iPhone. And it's going great so far. I'm sharing more pictures than ever. Almost every day in fact.</p>

    <p>For me that - publishing every day - is huge. I have more undeveloped films and RAW files than I could possibly go through. I always forget to share trip photos with friends. And not last, my Mom is constantly complaining she doesn't have enough recent pictures of me.</p>

    <p>I'm also posting to Facebook and Instagram. Everyone who knows me knows that social networks are not my thing. But I want to change that. I don’t have a particularly substantial following or anything but so far it’s going good.</p>

    <p>There's much to be learned still of course. About Facebook. About the esthetics of Instagram and what not.</p>

    <p>However, going from taking a picture to editing to publishing to all your followers in less than a minute is an amazing process, not doubt about that.</p>
