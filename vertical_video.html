    <h2>Vertical Video</h2>

    <p>I'd like to invite you to watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt9zSfinwFA">video on YouTube</a> about something called <em>Vertical Video Syndrome</em>:</p>

    <p><iframe width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Bt9zSfinwFA?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

    <p>It's a funny video. And <em>Fafa</em> is a cute beaver.</p>

    <p>But he's wrong. When they say "you can't really turn a video" because "televisions are horizontal" and "computer screens are horizontal". They forget about smart phone screens. Because they are not horizontal. And holding a smart phone vertically to watch a video, excuse me, but is just as idiotic as holding it that way to shoot one.</p>

    <p>I'm on Instagram just like any other person. And one thing I've noticed is that photos taken in portrait orientation look much better. And I enjoy them, and <em>like</em> them more often than vertical shots (which appear just tiny).</p>

    <p>I think YouTube should figure out a way and allow vertical video to be displayed in portrait orientation in full-screen. One time there was a glitch on a recent iOS beta and I could somehow reproduce this behavior by accident - it felt right.</p>

    <p>Vertical video isn't wrong. We just need more of it.</p>
