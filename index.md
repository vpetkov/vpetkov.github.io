Veselin's blog.
===============

I consider this page a draft. It's lacking in pictures at the moment. I am adding content in my spare time.

For the longest time this website had heavy focus on my photography. I still love to do it and when I have time traveling I still try to do some photography on the side. But all web galleries are shit and at this point I haven't really figured out what works well for showcasing photography on the web.

I want to be helpful and informative but writing on the internet is perhaps the most discouraging thing to do.

For now take me at my word when I say people find me friendly. Read more [about me](/about) or send me an email to something at vpetkov.com.

This website is made with GitHub Pages.
