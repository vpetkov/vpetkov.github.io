Veselin's blog.
==============

This is an early draft. I am adding content in my spare time`...`  
It's split in two parts - [first](/#work-related-topics) is more programming and work-related, and [below](/#personal-knowledge-sharing) that are various personal findings and conclusions of mine.

There is also an [/about](/about) page with some more background.


Work-related topics:
--------------------

I'm a Ruby on Rails programmer. At my job I deal with R&D project management and I'm not required to write code. Still, I have strong opinions on how software is built and delivered. In this section I share some of my more conversation-worthy views.

Developing for web mostly means producing websites. I like using bootstrap when building websites. I prefer to keep a simple and common layout. One favourite tool for verifying true simplicity is a text-only web browser called `w3m`.

Permalinks are very important. If you practice the single-page faith you better know some good URL kung-fu.

Last but not least, the *back* functionality should always work as expected. Even going back to an infinite scroll by hitting the browser's back button, the result should be seeing the content that was there the last time you saw it. Although if you're still doing infinite scrolling it's probably a good time to stop.

I have strong opinions about iOS. IMHO the Settings.app is the best when it comes to consistent, native experience. When in doubt, just go with tables -- as much as possible.

I am not experienced in TDD, however I have never worked on a project that is not well tested. In the Rails world `RSpec` is the framework everybody uses for real projects that are in production. In a ruby-centric dev team my preference so far has been to stay with as much Ruby code as possible, for everything, including feature testing and so-called automated QA. I have utilized junior ruby devs as the perfect worker-bees to provide dev support to an experienced QA team, to write specs using selenium-webdriver in order to automate front-end feature testing.

I love GitHub. My preferred workflow inside my team is the common flow we all use when contributing to open-source projects. First, fork the repo. Then, make a change and push your new feature branch in your fork (because nobody is allowed to push any branches to the main fork). And then make the pull request from the feature branch in your fork to a `develop` branch in the main fork. After code review and green tests merge the PR. The `develop` branch is then merged to `master` again with a pull request that also runs the tests, after which `master` is deployed.

Personal knowledge-sharing:
---------------------------

My friends think I'm odd when it comes to shoes, clothes and other earthly possessions. My view is I'm mostly practical, but read on and judge as you will.

Most people don't know this, but there are shoes that are built around the natural shape of the foot. It makes sense that all shoes should be like that, but most are actually not. Wearing proper shoes can bring some serious improvement to your life.

Best jeans are made from raw unwashed denim, that is stiff and doesn't stretch.  
I prefer Levi's vintage clothing because their classic 501 jeans have a comfortable high waist.  
`...`

Merino wool is a miracle.  
I'm a huge fan of Buffs. I also switched to mostly wool socks, even in the summertime. And recently I started wearing wool t-shirts as well.

I don't own a TV. I'm proud to say that statement is valid since 2007.

Finally, people say I'm friendly -- you can contact me by sending an email to something at vpetkov.com.
