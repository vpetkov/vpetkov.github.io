#### *This post is still a draft. Help me write it up*

When the iPhone 6 Plus first came out, Apple introduced for it a brand new layout with iPad-style side panels for landscape mode. But they left it in an unfinished state. It’s completely pointless now. I actually keep mine locked in portrait mode all the time.

Because the home screen rotates but not all native apps that come preinstalled support landscape mode it’s a constant game of turning it around and waiting for the excruciatingly slow animation to pick up.
