    <h2>Wool Socks</h2>

    <p>As I'm reloading My Orders page on Amazon in hope that the delivery date for the socks I ordered will change I'm reminded I haven't written anything in awhile.</p>

    <p>Let me tell you all about wool socks and my recently found obsession with them.</p>

    <p>Last winter I bought my first pair. Before that I always found the idea of winter socks (or to be fair, any sort of special socks) to be for the weak. But as I'm growing older, so is my body starting to irritate me more and more. I get sweaty in summer. In the winter I need to wear a hat. And my feet won't stay warm on their own anymore. All problems that 20 year old me never even heard of.</p>

    <p>Since a little kid I haven't had anything made from wool. As I remember wool is itchy and therefor unpleasant. So as I was cold a little more than a year ago on a short trip to Madrid I bought myself a sweatshirt to keep warm. It is made from wool and it's very nice. This newly found knowledge that wool is not unpleasant but in fact quite nice. And worm. I searched on the internet what other wool clothes I might get. This naturally brought me to socks. And my first ever pair of wool socks.</p>

    <p>Did you know that wool socks don't ever stink up? And as much as they are good to keep you warm without getting too hot, wools socks will also keep you cool in the summer and won't let your feet get sweaty.</p>

    <p>And do you like leather shoes? Everything that makes leather shoes great, all the qualities of natural materials, the breathability of the leather is completed by the qualities of wool socks acting as insulation while letting the moisture out and keeping your feet comfortable.</p>

    <p>Now I finally get the Bavarian Tracht. I might even get Lederhosen for this year's Oktoberfest ü§†üç∫</p>
