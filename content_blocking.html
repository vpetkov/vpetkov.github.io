    <h2>Content Blocking</h2>
    <p>You rarely get to watch as a new ethical paradigm is conceived around you. And it sucks to be on the wrong side of history. Especially when history in this case is the present.</p>

    <p>It all started when Apple introduced content-blocking to iOS. This sparked a conversation that brought to light some big topics. One that publishers rely too much on ads and clicks for their revenue. But also the topic of privacy. Tracking is a big part of what Google and Facebook are doing through ad scripts and social buttons - malware that publishers are serving their readership.</p>

    <p>I always thought that native advertising is the key. But not without oversight or we risk fake news to become the norm online.</p>

    <p>Another point of view might be value. Ads don't bring value to the customer. Content-blocking actually does. Value that can easily be translated in money as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/01/business/cost-of-mobile-ads.html?_r=0">NY Times once proved</a>.</p>

    <p>Seeing where the publishing business is today should be a clear sign of how capable of embracing progress traditional media is. I just hope sanity guides the market because we need newspapers and professional news outlets.</p>

    <p>But publishers aren't the only ones that stand to lose from the surging popularity of content-blockers. Nonprofits that rely on ads to publicize their causes are also worried the software could weaken their fund raising and outreach drives. Even UNICEF is actively against ad-blocking.</p>

    <p>The result is people of good taste who have been using ad-blockers for decades are now being systematically demonized by the press.</p>
