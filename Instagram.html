    <h2>Instagram</h2>

    <p>Just a quick note on where I stand on the topic of Instagram.</p>

    <p>Not sure how it came to this, but I disagree that Instagram is destroying photography. I hate the idea that photography should be this elite affair. And amateur photographers should be ridiculed and called hipsters just because they bought a big camera recently and want to have fun taking beautiful pictures.</p>

    <p>Well, beauty of course is seen differently by different people and that's fine. It makes photography (and especially amateur photography) even more interesting.</p>

    <p>I want to post more. And I want to use my iPhone to take pictures of sunsets and pasta and cats... Thing is, it's just not my nature.</p>

    <p>But everyone else, keep it up, please. üëç</p>
