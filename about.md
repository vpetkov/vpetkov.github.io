About Veselin
=============

When I'm not working I like to travel. The state of travelling is my true Zen. I read when I travel. I listen to books and podcasts. I bring my camera and take pictures. It's how I meditate.

Professionally I have been heavily invested in banking and fin-tech. My background is in programming with Ruby and Python.

I am currently the head of project management at Receipt Bank.
