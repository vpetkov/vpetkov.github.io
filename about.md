About Veselin
=============

I am personally heavily invested in banking and fin-tech.

Growing up I was fascinated by the impact a traditional commercial bank would have on people, particularly during turbulent times like the early 90s were. I learned everything about banking from my grandfather, who was a CEO of a bank. My father being an accountant, and my mother spending most of her professional career in corporate finance at various local banks was pretty helpful as well. So it should be no surprise that as kids we used to play 'bank' or 'merchant'.

Later, when I started looking for work my dream job would have been in web design for banks. That was a tough job market though.

I ended up in computational photography. It turned out great. I learned process and delivery in the context of software engineering as part of an external team outsourced and managed by Nokia - back when Nokia was a company building the future of communications and multimedia. I learned about estimation, iteration, technical documentation and code review there. All of which was new to me, and at that time to most of the industry.

### Delivering product to market requires the right organization to unlock flexibility and provide a framework for growth. It's tricky and necessary. The hard part is getting the culture right, to allow creativity and innovation. Quality is a point of view. 

At one time everybody around me was working with Ruby on Rails. I liked Ruby, but I was introduced to Python prior and it already sued my needs at that time so I didn't really pay much attention to the world of Ruby, and Rails in particular.

When I was fed up with my job at the time, outsourcing for LG, I turned to my friends. They pushed me to Ruby on Rails.
