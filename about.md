About Veselin
=============

I am personally heavily invested in banking and fin-tech.

Growing up I was fascinated by the impact a traditional commercial bank would have on people, particularly during turbulent times like the early 90s were. I learned everything about banking from my grandfather, who was a CEO of a bank. My father being an accountant, and my mother spending most of her professional career in corporate finance at various local banks was pretty helpful as well. So it should be no surprise that as kids we used to play 'bank' or 'merchant'.

Later, when I started looking for work my dream job would have been in web design for banks. That was a tough job market though.

I ended up in computational photography. It turned out great. I learned process and delivery in the context of software engineering as part of an external team outsourced and managed by Nokia - back when Nokia was a company building the future of communications and multimedia. I learned about estimation, iteration, technical documentation and code review there. All of which was new to me, and at that time to most of the industry.

At one time everybody around me was working with Ruby on Rails. I liked Ruby, but I was introduced to Python prior and it already sued my needs at that time so I didn't really pay much attention to the world of Ruby, and Rails in particular.

There is a very good reason for that. I was working mainly on test firmware and automated QA for pre-production ARM-based systems. We had plenty of room for experimentation. Everything was *C++* and supporting different environments was hell, having to pre-compile every time you make a change, or switch to a different chip, or different kernel, or board configuration. Pretty soon however all of my projects were powered by some standard-ish Linux distribution, either `.deb` or `.rpm` based. By the very end, it was actually mostly *Ubuntu on ARM*. I was using Python heavily -- I didn't have to compile anything, and utilizing the interactive shell provided me with a functional user interface, so I didn't have to write my own in order to operate the hardware in real time. It was a complete game changer to be able to quickly prototype, using `gstreamer`, full end-to-end multimedia pipeline and operate the complete stack in real time from the python interactive shell.

Using Python for work meant I was also comfortable using Python for all the small utility needs I have, while other people around me were using Ruby for that. So it wasn't until much later, when I was fed up with my job, which at that time had changed a bit, and I was outsourcing for LG -- when I turned to my friends for professional advice, they pushed me to Ruby on Rails.

### Delivering product to market requires the right organization as well as the right culture.

I was lucky to join a real fin-tech company in Germany with a full banking licence and an end-to-end Ruby on Rails stack that was already live. It felt like the absolutely perfect place for me, with Rails, true online banking, and a pretty flexible organization that allowed for fast iteration and experimentation.

During the next five years I learned that a well defined organizational structure is a much needed key to success. The right organization can unlock flexibility and provide a framework for growth. It is very tricky to get it right. And we did go through a few iterations. From flat-ish structure, to departments, to product teams, then delivery vs core-product, etc. The hard part turns out comes after the organization -- getting the culture right. To keep the talent in, and to allow creativity and innovation to continue once you've grown out of proportion.

### Quality is a point of view.
